# DevOpsDaysAdmin
SpringBoot app for DevOpsDaysAdmin

this app allows collecting of user names and emails.  If there is an actual specific lead capture that should be followed up on, there is also a means to capture that info as well as registering.

For database instances with no remote connection the data can be downloaded in a json or csv format

To choose the winner via a paper ticket assign each registrant a ticket number and draw the ticket.

Other option to choose winner is to download csv file and then use http://www.random.org to choose a random row number from corresponding csv file.
